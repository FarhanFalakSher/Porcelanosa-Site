            With the aim of improving patient services and care, hospitals,
            clinics and other healthcare entities have used PORCELANOSA products
            such as ventilated façades, exterior raised access flooring,
            recyclable pavements (STON-KER® Ecologic), ecological and adaptable
            bathroom fittings, geothermal systems and KRION® surfaces, whose
            Keast technology contributes to improving people's quality of life
            by purifying air, eliminating chemicals and improving surface
            hygiene. In addition, the KRION® Stone product line is a material
            specially designed for areas such as operating theatres and other
            medical facilities and that does not present joints, can be easily
            repaired and limits bacterial proliferation. For the proper
            execution of any project, the PORCELANOSA Group Public Works
            Department offers individual customers comprehensive advice and
            service.
