            Creating unique, elegant and comfortable spaces to build customer
            loyalty. These are the objectives that can be achieved with the
            materials of PORCELANOSA Group. To achieve this, the eight Group
            companies have proposed a series of products and collections based
            on natural products (wood, marble and slate) and ceramics (PAR-KER®)
            that withstand the passage of time, adverse weather and continued
            use. Metal mosaics and textile or stone-inspired wall tiles are also
            of particular importance, increasingly used in spaces such as halls,
            bathrooms and receptions.
