            To create sports spaces with design and material quality, easy
            maintenance and hygiene, PORCELANOSA Group proposes materials of
            high durability and sustainability. Large-format ceramics inspired
            by natural wood or marble, anti-bacterial KRION® surfaces created
            with Keast technology, and bathroom taps, toilets and fittings that
            regulate water consumption are some of the proposals that give such
            establishments greater breadth, resources and means.
