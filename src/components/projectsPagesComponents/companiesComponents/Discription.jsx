            Office and corporate space design
          </h2>

            The design of modern offices requires a balance between aesthetics,
            comfort and performance. PORCELANOSA Group meets these needs with
            large-format materials such as XLight, compact KRION® surfaces,
            high-performance ceramic flooring and natural coverings that promote
            visual continuity. Neutral tones—whites, greys, sands or
            anthracites—and textures inspired by wood, cement or natural stone
            help create professional, orderly and timeless environments. Design,
            innovation and sustainability come together to transform the office
            into a space that fosters talent and strengthens corporate identity.
