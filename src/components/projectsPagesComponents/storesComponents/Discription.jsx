            To enhance the luminosity and image of any retail space, the eight
            companies of the Group are committed to sustainable and reusable
            materials, as well as to neutral colours such as white, sand and
            grey. PORCELANOSA Group collections are highly resistant to high and
            low temperatures, as well as to the impact of chemical and human
            agents and traffic (Forest from PAR-KER®, KRION® and XLight). The
            products of our eight brands are defined by their versatility,
            lightness and durability, three qualities that strengthen the
            possibilities of each establishment through design, product quality
            and customer comfort.
